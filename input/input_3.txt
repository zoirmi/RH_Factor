      Artist Biography by Richie Unterberger

"Soul Brother Number One," "The Godfather of Soul," "The Hardest Working
Man in Show Business," "Mr. Dynamite" -- those are mighty titles, but no
one can question that James Brown
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/james-brown-mn0000128099> earned them
more than any other performer. Other singers were more popular, others
were equally skilled, but few other musicians were so influential over
the course of popular music. And no other musician put on a more
exciting, exhilarating stage show: Brown
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brown-mn0000128099>'s performances were
marvels of athletic stamina and split-second timing. Through the
gospel-impassioned fury of his vocals and the complex polyrhythms of his
beats, Brown <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brown-mn0000128099> was a
crucial midwife in not just one, but two revolutions in American music;
he was one of the figures most responsible for turning R&B into soul and
he was, most would agree, the one figure most responsible for
transforming soul music into funk. Fittingly, his music became even more
influential as it aged, since his voice and rhythms were sampled on
innumerable hip-hop recordings, and critics belatedly hailed his
innovations as among the most important in all of rock or R&B.

Brown <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brown-mn0000128099>'s
rags-to-riches-to-rags story has heroic and tragic dimensions of mythic
resonance. Born into poverty in the South, he ran afoul of the law by
the late '40s on an armed robbery conviction. With the help of singer
Bobby Byrd <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/bobby-byrd-mn0000059101>'s
family, Brown <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brown-mn0000128099>
gained parole and started a gospel group with Byrd
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/byrd-mn0000059101>, changing their
focus to R&B as the rock revolution gained steam. The Flames
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-flames-mn0000128676>, as the
Georgian group was known in the mid-'50s, signed to Federal/King and had
a huge R&B hit right off the bat with the wrenching, churchy ballad
"Please, Please, Please." By that point, the Flames had become James
Brown & the Famous Flames
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/james-brown-the-famous-flames-mn0001600306>;
the charisma, energy, and talent of Brown
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brown-mn0000128099> made him the
natural star attraction.

All of Brown <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brown-mn0000128099>'s
singles over the next two years flopped, as he sought to establish his
own style, recording material that was obviously derivative of heroes
like Roy Brown <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/roy-brown-mn0000343396>,
Hank Ballard
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/hank-ballard-mn0000664194>, Little
Richard <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/little-richard-mn0000824022>,
and Ray Charles
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/ray-charles-mn0000046861>. In
retrospect, it can be seen that Brown
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brown-mn0000128099> was in the same
position as dozens of other R&B one-shots: talented singers in need of
better songs, or not fully on the road to a truly original sound. What
made Brown <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brown-mn0000128099> succeed
where hundreds of others failed was his superhuman determination,
working the chitlin circuit to death, sharpening his band, and keeping
an eye on new trends. He was on the verge of being dropped by King in
late 1958 when his perseverance finally paid off, as "Try Me" became a
number one R&B (and small pop) hit, and several follow-ups established
him as a regular visitor to the R&B charts.

Live at the Apollo
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/live-at-the-apollo-mw0000308565> Brown
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brown-mn0000128099>'s style of R&B got
harder as the '60s began; he added more complex, Latin- and
jazz-influenced rhythms on hits like "Good Good Lovin'," "I'll Go
Crazy," "Think," and "Night Train," alternating these with torturous
ballads that featured some of the most frayed screaming to be heard
outside of the church. Black audiences already knew that Brown
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brown-mn0000128099> had the most
exciting live act around, but he truly started to become a phenomenon
with the release of Live at the Apollo
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/live-at-the-apollo-mw0000308565> in
1963. Capturing a Brown
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brown-mn0000128099> concert with all
its whirling-dervish energy and calculated spontaneity, the album
reached number two on the album charts, an unprecedented feat for a
hardcore R&B LP.

Live at the Apollo
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/live-at-the-apollo-mw0000308565> was
recorded and released against the wishes of the King label. It was this
kind of artistic standoff that led Brown
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brown-mn0000128099> to seek better
opportunities elsewhere. In 1964, he ignored his King contract to record
"Out of Sight" for Smash, igniting a lengthy legal battle that prevented
him from issuing vocal recordings for about a year. When he finally
resumed recording for King in 1965, he had a new contract that granted
him far more artistic control over his releases.

Brown <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brown-mn0000128099>'s new era had
truly begun, however, with "Out of Sight," which topped the R&B charts
and made the pop Top 40. For some time, Brown
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brown-mn0000128099> had been moving
toward more elemental lyrics that threw in as many chants and screams as
they did words, and more intricate beats and horn charts that took some
of their cues from the ensemble work of jazz outfits. "Out of Sight"
wasn't called funk when it came out, but it had most of the essential
ingredients. These were amplified and perfected on 1965's "Papa's Got a
Brand New Bag," a monster that finally broke Brown
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brown-mn0000128099> to a white
audience, reaching the Top Ten. The even more adventurous follow-up, "I
Got You (I Feel Good)," did even better, making number three.

These hits kicked off Brown
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brown-mn0000128099>'s period of
greatest commercial success and public visibility. From 1965 to the end
of the decade, he was rarely off the R&B charts, often on the pop
listings, and all over the concert circuit and national television, even
meeting with Vice President Hubert Humphrey and other important
politicians as a representative of the Black community. His music became
even bolder and funkier, as melody was dispensed with almost altogether
in favor of chunky rhythms and magnetic interplay between his vocals,
horns, drums, and scratching electric guitar (heard to best advantage on
hits like "Cold Sweat," "I Got the Feelin'," and "There Was a Time").
The lyrics were not so much words as chanted, stream-of-consciousness
slogans, often aligning themselves with Black pride as well as good
old-fashioned (or new-fashioned) sex. Much of the credit for the sound
he devised belonged to (and has now been belatedly attributed to) his
top-notch supporting musicians such as saxophonists Maceo Parker
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/maceo-parker-mn0000185155>, St. Clair
Pinckney
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/st-clair-pinckney-mn0000791667>, and
Pee Wee Ellis
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/pee-wee-ellis-mn0000305424>; guitarist
Jimmy Nolen <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/jimmy-nolen-mn0000089019>;
backup singer and longtime loyal associate Bobby Byrd
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/bobby-byrd-mn0000059101>; and drummer
Clyde Stubblefield
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/clyde-stubblefield-mn0000132163>.

Brown <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brown-mn0000128099> was both a
brilliant bandleader and a stern taskmaster, the latter leading his band
to walk out on him in late 1969. Amazingly, he turned the crisis to his
advantage by recruiting a young Cincinnati outfit called the Pacemakers
featuring guitarist Catfish Collins
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/catfish-collins-mn0000163072> and
bassist Bootsy Collins
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/bootsy-collins-mn0000107139>. Although
they only stayed with him for about a year, they were crucial to Brown
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brown-mn0000128099>'s evolution into
even harder funk, emphasizing the rhythm and the bottom even more. The
Collins brothers, for their part, put their apprenticeship to good use,
helping define '70s funk as members of the Parliament
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/parliament-mn0000129775>-Funkadelic
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/funkadelic-mn0000187581> axis.

In the early '70s, many of the most important members of Brown
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brown-mn0000128099>'s late-'60s band
returned to the fold, to be billed as the J.B.'s
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-jbs-mn0000071970> (they also made
records on their own). Brown
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brown-mn0000128099> continued to score
heavily on the R&B charts throughout the first half of the '70s, the
music becoming more and more elemental and beat-driven. At the same
time, he was retreating from the white audience he had cultivated during
the mid- to late '60s; records like "Make It Funky," "Hot Pants," "Get
on the Good Foot," and "The Payback" were huge soul sellers, but only
modest pop ones. Critics charged, with some justification, that the
Godfather was starting to repeat and recycle himself too many times. It
must be remembered, though, that these songs were made for the singles
radio jukebox market and not meant to be played one after the other on
CD compilations (as they are today).

By the mid-'70s, Brown
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brown-mn0000128099> was beginning to
burn out artistically. He seemed shorn of new ideas, was being
out-gunned on the charts by disco, and was running into problems with
the IRS and his financial empire. There were sporadic hits, and he could
always count on enthusiastic live audiences, but by the '80s, he didn't
have a label. With the explosion of rap, however, which frequently
sampled vintage J.B.'s
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/jbs-mn0000071970> records, Brown
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brown-mn0000128099> became hipper than
ever. He collaborated with Afrika Bambaataa
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/afrika-bambaataa-mn0000929862> on the
critical smash single "Unity" and reentered the Top Ten in 1986 with
"Living in America." Rock critics, who had always ranked Brown
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brown-mn0000128099> considerably below
Otis Redding <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/otis-redding-mn0000414251>
and Aretha Franklin
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/aretha-franklin-mn0000927555> in the
soul canon, began to reevaluate his output, particularly the material
from his funk years, sometimes anointing him not just "Soul Brother
Number One," but the most important Black musician of the rock era.

In 1988, Brown <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brown-mn0000128099>'s
personal life came crashing down in a well-publicized incident in which
he was accused by his wife of assault and battery. After a year skirting
hazy legal and personal troubles, he led the police on an interstate car
chase after allegedly threatening people with a handgun. The episode
ended in a six-year prison sentence that many felt was excessive; he was
paroled after serving two years.

Love Over-Due
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/love-over-due-mw0000675126> Throughout
the '90s, Brown <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brown-mn0000128099>
continued to perform and release new material like Love Over-Due
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/love-over-due-mw0000675126> (1991),
Universal James
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/universal-james-mw0000727915> (1992),
and I'm Back <https://www.allmusic.com/album/im-back-mw0000044958>
(1998). While none of these recordings could be considered as important
as his earlier work and did little to increase his popularity, his
classic catalog became more popular in the American mainstream during
this time than it had been since the '70s, and not just among young
rappers and samplers. One of the main reasons for this was a proper
presentation of his recorded legacy. For a long time, his cumbersome,
byzantine discography was mostly out of print, with pieces available
only on skimpy greatest-hits collections. A series of exceptionally
well-packaged reissues on PolyGram changed that situation; the Star Time
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/star-time-mw0000654673> box set is the
best overview, with other superb compilations devoted to specific phases
of his lengthy career, from '50s R&B to '70s funk.

In 2004, Brown <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brown-mn0000128099> was
diagnosed with prostate cancer but successfully fought the disease. By
2006, it was in remission and Brown
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brown-mn0000128099>, then 73, began a
global tour dubbed the Seven Decades of Funk World Tour. Late in the
year while at a routine dentist appointment, the singer was diagnosed
with pneumonia. He was admitted to the hospital for treatment but died
of heart failure a few days later, in the early morning hours of
