      Artist Biography by Linda Seida

Kind of Blue <https://www.allmusic.com/album/kind-of-blue-mw0000191710>
Erik Truffaz <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/erik-truffaz-mn0000203351>
received an early introduction into the world of a professional
musician, thanks to his saxophone-playing dad. When he was ten years
old, the French trumpeter began performing in his father's dance band.
As he grew older, Truffaz
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/truffaz-mn0000203351> performed with
other bands in the region until he was 16 and heard Kind of Blue
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/kind-of-blue-mw0000191710> by Miles
Davis <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/miles-davis-mn0000423829>. The
great jazz trumpeter's music inspired him to learn more, and he set off
for Switzerland's Geneva Conservatoire, where he became a student.
Truffaz <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/truffaz-mn0000203351>'s
repertoire expanded to works by Mozart
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/mozart-mn0001676655> and Verdi
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/verdi-mn0000252723>, and he performed
as part of L'Orchestre de Suisse Romande
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/lorchestre-de-suisse-romande-mn0000153577>.
He also played in cover bands before establishing a group called Orange.
The band concentrated on Truffaz
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/truffaz-mn0000203351>'s compositions.
Among its members was Marc Erbetta
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/marc-erbetta-mn0001818908>, a drummer
who continued to play with Truffaz
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/truffaz-mn0000203351> as the trumpeter
evolved.

The Mask <https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-mask-mw0000067462> Truffaz
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/truffaz-mn0000203351>'s jazz fusion
artistry led France's Jury du Concours National de la Defense to bestow
upon him the 1991 Prix Special, that country's coveted jazz award.
Within three years, he became a leader with the release of Nina Valeria.
In 1991, he made the first of his three appearances on the stage of the
Montreux Jazz Festival. For two years beginning in 1994, he toured
Europe, Russia, and Brazil, thanks to funds bestowed by the ProHelvetia
Foundation. In 2000, Truffaz
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/truffaz-mn0000203351> signed with Blue
Note Records and released The Mask
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-mask-mw0000067462>, a straight-ahead
jazz session with Miles Davis
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/miles-davis-mn0000423829> similarities.
By his second Revisité
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/revisit%C3%A9-mw0000004119> and third
Mantis <https://www.allmusic.com/album/mantis-mw0000220627> discs,
however, Truffaz <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/truffaz-mn0000203351>
began to stretch the boundaries of contemporary jazz by incorporating
drum'n'bass and hip-hop rhythms, establishing himself as a cutting-edge
artist in his own right. In 2003, both Walk of the Giant Turtle
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/walk-of-the-giant-turtle-mw0000028966>
and Bending New Corners
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/bending-new-corners-mw0000366330> were
issued on Blue Note. Saloua
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/saloua-mw0000206558> from 2005 expanded
his interest in hip-hop by adding some rap. From there he continued to
release records that blurred genre lines, regularly collaborating with
French hip-hop artist Oxmo Puccino
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/oxmo-puccino-mn0000502254>. By the time
he began recording 2015's Doni Doni
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/doni-doni-mw0002905283> it was time for
longtime drummer Marc Erbetta
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/marc-erbetta-mn0001818908> to hand over
the drumsticks to Arthur Hnatek
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/arthur-hnatek-mn0003379099>, a young
yet very talented musician known for his work with the likes of Tigran
Hamasyan <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/tigran-hamasyan-mn0000558985>,
John Patitucci
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/john-patitucci-mn0000188776>, and Shai
Maestro <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/shai-maestro-mn0000995698>.
