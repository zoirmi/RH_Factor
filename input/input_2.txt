      Artist Biography by William Ruhlmann

Birth of the Cool
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/birth-of-the-cool-mw0000111184> A
monumental innovator, icon, and maverick, trumpeter Miles Davis
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/miles-davis-mn0000423829> helped define
the course of jazz as well as popular culture in the 20th century,
bridging the gap between bebop, modal music, funk, and fusion.
Throughout most of his 50-year career, Davis
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829> played the trumpet
in a lyrical, introspective style, often employing a stemless Harmon
mute to make his sound more personal and intimate. It was a style that,
along with his brooding stage persona, earned him the nickname "Prince
of Darkness." However, Davis
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829> proved to be a
dazzlingly protean artist, moving into fiery modal jazz in the '60s and
electrified funk and fusion in the '70s, drenching his trumpet in
wah-wah pedal effects along the way. More than any other figure in jazz,
Davis <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829> helped
establish the direction of the genre with a steady stream of
boundary-pushing recordings, among them 1957's chamber jazz album Birth
of the Cool
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/birth-of-the-cool-mw0000111184> (which
collected recordings from 1949-1950), 1959's modal masterpiece Kind of
Blue <https://www.allmusic.com/album/kind-of-blue-mw0000191710>, 1960's
orchestral album Sketches of Spain
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/sketches-of-spain-mw0000191713>, and
1970's landmark fusion recording Bitches Brew
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/bitches-brew-mw0000188019>. Davis
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829>' own playing was
obviously at the forefront of those changes, but he also distinguished
himself as a bandleader, regularly surrounding himself with sidemen and
collaborators who likewise moved in new directions, including the
luminaries John Coltrane
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/john-coltrane-mn0000175553>, Herbie
Hancock <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/herbie-hancock-mn0000957296>,
Bill Evans <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/bill-evans-mn0000764702>,
Wayne Shorter
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/wayne-shorter-mn0000250435>, Chick
Corea <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/chick-corea-mn0000110541>, and
many more. While he remains one of the most referenced figures in jazz,
a major touchstone for generations of trumpeters (including Wynton
Marsalis <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/wynton-marsalis-mn0000961688>,
Chris Botti <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/chris-botti-mn0000105329>,
and Nicholas Payton
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/nicholas-payton-mn0000335431>), his
music reaches far beyond the jazz tradition, and can be heard in the
genre-bending approach of performers across the musical spectrum,
ranging from funk and pop to rock, electronica, hip-hop, and more.

Born in 1926, Davis <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829>
was the son of dental surgeon, Dr. Miles Dewey Davis, Jr., and a music
teacher, Cleota Mae (Henry) Davis, and grew up in the Black middle class
of East St. Louis after the family moved there shortly after his birth.
He became interested in music during his childhood and by the age of 12
began taking trumpet lessons. While still in high school, he got jobs
playing in local bars and at 16 was playing gigs out of town on
weekends. At 17, he joined Eddie Randle's Blue Devils, a territory band
based in St. Louis. He enjoyed a personal apotheosis in 1944, just after
graduating from high school, when he saw and was allowed to sit in with
Billy Eckstine
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/billy-eckstine-mn0000082584>'s big
band, which was playing in St. Louis. The band featured trumpeter Dizzy
Gillespie <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/dizzy-gillespie-mn0000162677>
and saxophonist Charlie Parker
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/charlie-parker-mn0000211758>, the
architects of the emerging bebop style of jazz, which was characterized
by fast, inventive soloing and dynamic rhythm variations.

It is striking that Davis
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829> fell so completely
under Gillespie <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/gillespie-mn0000162677>
and Parker <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/parker-mn0000211758>'s
spell, since his own slower and less flashy style never really compared
to theirs. But bebop was the new sound of the day, and the young
trumpeter was bound to follow it. He did so by leaving the Midwest to
attend the Institute of Musical Art in New York City (renamed Juilliard)
in September 1944. Shortly after his arrival in Manhattan, he was
playing in clubs with Parker
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/parker-mn0000211758>, and by 1945 he
had abandoned his academic studies for a full-time career as a jazz
musician, initially joining Benny Carter
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/benny-carter-mn0000790083>'s band and
making his first recordings as a sideman. He played with Eckstine
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/eckstine-mn0000082584> in 1946-1947 and
was a member of Parker
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/parker-mn0000211758>'s group in
1947-1948, making his recording debut as a leader on a 1947 session that
featured Parker <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/parker-mn0000211758>,
pianist John Lewis
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/john-lewis-mn0000424292>, bassist
Nelson Boyd <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/nelson-boyd-mn0000805222>,
and drummer Max Roach
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/max-roach-mn0000396372>. This was an
isolated date, however, and Davis
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829> spent most of his
time playing and recording behind Parker
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/parker-mn0000211758>. But in the summer
of 1948, he organized a nine-piece band with an unusual horn section. In
addition to himself, it featured an alto saxophone, a baritone
saxophone, a trombone, a French horn, and a tuba. This nonet, employing
arrangements by Gil Evans
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/gil-evans-mn0000551815> and others,
played for two weeks at the Royal Roost in New York in September.
Earning a contract with Capitol Records, the band went into the studio
in January 1949 for the first of three sessions and produced 12 tracks
that attracted little attention at first. The band's relaxed sound,
however, affected the musicians who played it, among them Kai Winding
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/kai-winding-mn0000352164>, Lee Konitz
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/lee-konitz-mn0000227776>, Gerry
Mulligan <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/gerry-mulligan-mn0000542549>,
John Lewis <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/john-lewis-mn0000424292>,
J.J. Johnson <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/jj-johnson-mn0000119111>,
and Kenny Clarke
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/kenny-clarke-mn0000081796>, and it had
a profound influence on the development of the cool jazz style on the
West Coast. (In February 1957, Capitol finally issued the tracks
together on an LP called Birth of the Cool
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/birth-of-the-cool-mw0000111184>.)

'Round About Midnight
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/round-about-midnight-mw0000649471> Davis
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829>, meanwhile, had
moved on to co-leading a band with pianist Tadd Dameron
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/tadd-dameron-mn0000016759> in 1949, and
the group took him out of the country for an appearance at the Paris
Jazz Festival in May. But the trumpeter's progress was impeded by an
addiction to heroin that plagued him in the early '50s. His performances
and recordings became more haphazard, but in January 1951 he began a
long series of recordings for the Prestige label that became his main
recording outlet for the next several years. He managed to kick his
habit by the middle of the decade, and he made a strong impression
playing "'Round Midnight" at the Newport Jazz Festival in July 1955, a
performance that led major-label Columbia to sign him. The prestigious
contract allowed him to put together a permanent band, and he organized
a quintet featuring saxophonist John Coltrane
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/john-coltrane-mn0000175553>, pianist
Red Garland <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/red-garland-mn0000882950>,
bassist Paul Chambers
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/paul-chambers-mn0000747984>, and
drummer Philly Joe Jones
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/philly-joe-jones-mn0000845443>, who
began recording his Columbia debut, 'Round About Midnight
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/round-about-midnight-mw0000649471>, in
October.

The New Miles Davis Quintet
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-new-miles-davis-quintet-mw0000200095> As
it happened, however, he had a remaining five albums on his Prestige
contract, and over the next year he was forced to alternate his Columbia
sessions with sessions for Prestige to fulfill this previous commitment.
The latter resulted in the Prestige albums The New Miles Davis Quintet
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-new-miles-davis-quintet-mw0000200095>,
Cookin' <https://www.allmusic.com/album/cookin-mw0000649470>, Workin'
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/workin-mw0000649474>, Relaxin'
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/relaxin-mw0000188060>, and Steamin'
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/steamin-mw0000191715>, making Davis
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829>' first quintet one
of his better-documented outfits. In May 1957, just three months after
Capitol released the Birth of the Cool
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/birth-of-the-cool-mw0000111184> LP,
Davis <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829> again teamed
with arranger Gil Evans
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/gil-evans-mn0000551815> for his second
Columbia LP, Miles Ahead
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/miles-ahead-mw0000649469>. Playing
flügelhorn, Davis <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829>
fronted a big band on music that extended the Birth of the Cool
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/birth-of-the-cool-mw0000111184> concept
and even had classical overtones. Released in 1958, the album was later
inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, intended to honor recordings made
before the Grammy Awards were instituted in 1959.

Ascenseur pour l'Échafaud [Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/ascenseur-pour-l%C3chafaud-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-mw0000203518>
In December 1957, Davis
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829> returned to Paris,
where he improvised the background music for the film L'Ascenseur pour
l'Echafaud
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/lascenseur-pour-lechafaud-mw0000203518>.
Jazz Track <https://www.allmusic.com/album/jazz-track-mw0000896705>, an
album containing this music, earned him a 1960 Grammy nomination for
Best Jazz Performance, Solo or Small Group. He added saxophonist
Cannonball Adderley
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/cannonball-adderley-mn0000548338> to
his group, creating the Miles Davis Sextet
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-miles-davis-sextet-mn0000499401>,
which recorded Milestones
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/milestones-mw0000191711> in April 1958.
Shortly after this recording, Red Garland
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/red-garland-mn0000882950> was replaced
on piano by Bill Evans
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/bill-evans-mn0000764702> and Jimmy Cobb
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/jimmy-cobb-mn0000350892> took over for
Philly Joe Jones
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/philly-joe-jones-mn0000845443> on
drums. In July, Davis
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829> again collaborated
with Gil Evans <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/gil-evans-mn0000551815>
and an orchestra on an album of music from Porgy and Bess
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/porgy-and-bess-mw0000191712>. Back in
the sextet, Davis <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829>
began to experiment with modal playing, basing his improvisations on
scales rather than chord changes.

This led to his next band recording, Kind of Blue
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/kind-of-blue-mw0000191710>, in March and
April 1959, an album that became a landmark in modern jazz and the most
popular album of Davis
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829>' career, eventually
selling over two million copies, a phenomenal success for a jazz record.
In sessions held in November 1959 and March 1960, Davis
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829> again followed his
pattern of alternating band releases and collaborations with Gil Evans
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/gil-evans-mn0000551815>, recording
Sketches of Spain
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/sketches-of-spain-mw0000191713>,
containing traditional Spanish music and original compositions in that
style. The album earned Davis
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829> and Evans
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/evans-mn0000551815> Grammy nominations
in 1960 for Best Jazz Performance, Large Group, and Best Jazz
Composition, More Than 5 Minutes; they won in the latter category.

Someday My Prince Will Come
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/someday-my-prince-will-come-mw0000187921> By
the time Davis <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829>
returned to the studio to make his next band album in March 1961,
Adderley <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/adderley-mn0000423829> had
departed, Wynton Kelly
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/wynton-kelly-mn0000684253> had replaced
Bill Evans <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/bill-evans-mn0000764702> at
the piano, and John Coltrane
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/john-coltrane-mn0000175553> had left to
begin his successful solo career, being replaced by saxophonist Hank
Mobley <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/hank-mobley-mn0000951384>
(following the brief tenure of Sonny Stitt
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/sonny-stitt-mn0000044290>).
Nevertheless, Coltrane
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/coltrane-mn0000175553> guested on a
couple of tracks of the album, called Someday My Prince Will Come
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/someday-my-prince-will-come-mw0000187921>.
The record made the pop charts in March 1962, but it was preceded into
the best-seller lists by the Davis
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829> quintet's next
recording, the two-LP set Miles Davis in Person (Friday & Saturday
Nights at the Blackhawk, San Francisco)
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/miles-davis-in-person-friday-saturday-nights-at-the-blackhawk-san-francisco-mw0000028505>,
recorded in April. The following month, Davis
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829> recorded another
live show, as he and his band were joined by an orchestra led by Gil
Evans <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/gil-evans-mn0000551815> at
Carnegie Hall in May. The resulting Miles Davis at Carnegie Hall
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/miles-davis-at-carnegie-hall-mw0000598156>
was his third LP to reach the pop charts, and it earned Davis
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829> and Evans
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/evans-mn0000551815> a 1962 Grammy
nomination for Best Jazz Performance by a Large Group, Instrumental.
Davis <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829> and Evans
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/evans-mn0000551815> teamed up again in
1962 for what became their final collaboration, Quiet Nights
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/quiet-nights-mw0000187920>. The album
was not issued until 1964, when it reached the charts and earned a
Grammy nomination for Best Instrumental Jazz Performance by a Large
Group or Soloist with Large Group.

Miles Davis and Gil Evans: The Complete Columbia Studio Recordings
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/miles-davis-and-gil-evans-the-complete-columbia-studio-recordings-mw0000176314>
In 1996, Columbia Records released a six-CD box set, Miles Davis & Gil
Evans: The Complete Columbia Studio Recordings
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/miles-davis-gil-evans-the-complete-columbia-studio-recordings-mw0000176314>,
that won the Grammy for Best Historical Album. Quiet Nights
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/quiet-nights-mw0000187920> was preceded
into the marketplace by Davis
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829>' next band effort,
Seven Steps to Heaven
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/seven-steps-to-heaven-mw0000188023>,
recorded in the spring of 1963 with an entirely new lineup consisting of
saxophonist George Coleman
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/george-coleman-mn0000642196>, pianist
Victor Feldman
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/victor-feldman-mn0000977537>, bassist
Ron Carter <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/ron-carter-mn0000275832>,
and drummer Frank Butler
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/frank-butler-mn0000189848>. During the
sessions, Feldman <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/feldman-mn0000814942>
was replaced by Herbie Hancock
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/herbie-hancock-mn0000957296> and Butler
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/butler-mn0001765202> by Tony Williams
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/tony-williams-mn0000791318>. The album
found Davis <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829> making
a transition to his next great group, of which Carter
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/carter-mn0000275832>, Hancock
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/hancock-mn0000957296>, and Williams
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/williams-mn0000791318> would be
members. It was another pop chart entry that earned 1963 Grammy
nominations for both Best Instrumental Jazz Performance by a Soloist or
Small Group and Best Instrumental Jazz Performance by a Large Group. The
quintet followed with two live albums, Miles Davis in Europe
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/miles-davis-in-europe-mw0000266413>,
recorded in July 1963, which made the pop charts and earned a 1964
Grammy nomination for Best Instrumental Jazz Performance by a Small
Group or Soloist with Small Group, and My Funny Valentine
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/my-funny-valentine-mw0000023241>,
recorded in February 1964 and released in 1965, when it reached the pop
charts.

E.S.P. <https://www.allmusic.com/album/esp-mw0000649468> By September
1964, the final member of the classic Miles Davis Quintet
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/miles-davis-quintet-mn0000423829> of
the '60s was in place with the addition of saxophonist Wayne Shorter
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/wayne-shorter-mn0000250435> to the team
of Davis <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829>, Carter
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/carter-mn0000275832>, Hancock
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/hancock-mn0000957296>, and Williams
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/williams-mn0000791318>. While
continuing to play standards in concert, this unit embarked on a series
of albums of original compositions contributed by the bandmembers
themselves, starting in January 1965 with E.S.P.
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/esp-mw0000649468>, followed by Miles
Smiles <https://www.allmusic.com/album/miles-smiles-mw0000197655> (1967
Grammy nomination for Best Instrumental Jazz Performance by a Small
Group or Soloist with Small Group [7 or Fewer]), Sorcerer
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/sorcerer-mw0000197402>, Nefertiti
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/nefertiti-mw0000208121>, Miles in the
Sky <https://www.allmusic.com/album/miles-in-the-sky-mw0000652711> (1968
Grammy nomination for Best Instrumental Jazz Performance by a Small
Group or Soloist with Small Group), and Filles de Kilimanjaro
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/filles-de-kilimanjaro-mw0000201628>. By
the time of Miles in the Sky
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/miles-in-the-sky-mw0000652711>, the
group had begun to turn to electric instruments, presaging Davis
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829>' next stylistic
turn. By the final sessions for Filles de Kilimanjaro
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/filles-de-kilimanjaro-mw0000201628> in
September 1968, Hancock
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/hancock-mn0000957296> had been replaced
by Chick Corea
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/chick-corea-mn0000110541> and Carter
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/carter-mn0000275832> by Dave Holland
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/dave-holland-mn0000585092>. But Hancock
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/hancock-mn0000957296>, along with
pianist Joe Zawinul
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/joe-zawinul-mn0000176859> and guitarist
John McLaughlin
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/john-mclaughlin-mn0000223701>,
participated on Davis
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829>' next album, In a
Silent Way <https://www.allmusic.com/album/in-a-silent-way-mw0000188020>
(1969), which returned the trumpeter to the pop charts for the first
time in four years and earned him another small-group jazz performance
Grammy nomination. With his next album, Bitches Brew
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/bitches-brew-mw0000188019>, Davis
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829> turned more overtly
to a jazz-rock style. Though certainly not conventional rock music,
Davis <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829>' electrified
sound attracted a young, non-jazz audience while putting off traditional
jazz fans.

Miles Davis at Fillmore: Live at the Fillmore East
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/miles-davis-at-fillmore-live-at-the-fillmore-east-mw0000193913>
Bitches Brew <https://www.allmusic.com/album/bitches-brew-mw0000188019>,
released in March 1970, reached the pop Top 40 and became Davis
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829>' first album to be
certified gold. It also earned a Grammy nomination for Best Instrumental
Arrangement and won the Grammy for large-group jazz performance. He
followed it with such similar efforts as Miles Davis at Fillmore East
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/miles-davis-at-fillmore-east-mw0000193913>
(1971 Grammy nomination for Best Jazz Performance by a Group), A Tribute
to Jack Johnson
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/a-tribute-to-jack-johnson-mw0000311307>,
Live-Evil <https://www.allmusic.com/album/live-evil-mw0000651475>, On
the Corner <https://www.allmusic.com/album/on-the-corner-mw0000197892>,
and In Concert <https://www.allmusic.com/album/in-concert-mw0000019948>,
all of which reached the pop charts. Meanwhile, Davis
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829>' former sidemen
became his disciples in a series of fusion groups: Corea
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/corea-mn0000110541> formed Return to
Forever
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/return-to-forever-mn0000463527>,
Shorter <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/shorter-mn0000250435> and
Zawinul <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/zawinul-mn0000176859> led
Weather Report
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/weather-report-mn0000243527>, and
McLaughlin <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/mclaughlin-mn0000809197> and
former Davis <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829>
drummer Billy Cobham
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/billy-cobham-mn0000767741> organized
the Mahavishnu Orchestra
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-mahavishnu-orchestra-mn0000233862>.
Starting in October 1972, when he broke his ankles in a car accident,
Davis <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829> became less
active in the early '70s, and in 1975 he gave up recording entirely due
to illness, undergoing surgery for hip replacement later in the year.
Five years passed before he returned to action by recording The Man with
the Horn
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-man-with-the-horn-mw0000649472> in
1980 and going back to touring in 1981.

We Want Miles
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/we-want-miles-mw0000022719> By now, he
was an elder statesman of jazz, and his innovations had been
incorporated into the music, at least by those who supported his
eclectic approach. He was also a celebrity whose appeal extended far
beyond the basic jazz audience. He performed on the worldwide jazz
festival circuit and recorded a series of albums that made the pop
charts, including We Want Miles
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/we-want-miles-mw0000022719> (1982 Grammy
Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance by a Soloist), Star People
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/star-people-mw0000023240>, Decoy
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/decoy-mw0000187880>, and You're Under
Arrest <https://www.allmusic.com/album/youre-under-arrest-mw0000191714>.
In 1986, after 30 years with Columbia, he switched to Warner Bros. and
released Tutu <https://www.allmusic.com/album/tutu-mw0000188059>, which
won him his fourth Grammy for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance.

Aura <https://www.allmusic.com/album/aura-mw0000654153> Aura
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/aura-mw0000654153>, an album he had
recorded in 1984, was released by Columbia in 1989 and brought him his
fifth Grammy for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance by a Soloist (on a
Jazz Recording). Davis
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829> surprised jazz fans
when, on July 8, 1991, he joined an orchestra led by Quincy Jones
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/quincy-jones-mn0000378624> at the
Montreux Jazz Festival to perform some of the arrangements written for
him in the late '50s by Gil Evans
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/gil-evans-mn0000551815>; he had never
previously looked back at an aspect of his career. He died of pneumonia,
respiratory failure, and a stroke within months. Doo-Bop
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/doo-bop-mw0000078184>, his last studio
album, appeared in 1992. It was a collaboration with rapper Easy Mo Bee
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/easy-mo-bee-mn0000167944>, and it won a
Grammy for Best Rhythm & Blues Instrumental Performance, with the track
"Fantasy" nominated for Best Jazz Instrumental Solo. Released in 1993,
Miles & Quincy Live at Montreux
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/miles-quincy-live-at-montreux-mw0000099361>
won Davis <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829> his
seventh Grammy for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Performance.

Everything's Beautiful
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/everythings-beautiful-mw0002928886>
Miles Davis <https://www.allmusic.com/artist/miles-davis-mn0000423829>
took an all-inclusive, constantly restless approach to jazz that won him
accolades and earned him controversy during his lifetime. It was hard to
recognize the bebop acolyte of Charlie Parker
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/charlie-parker-mn0000211758> in the
flamboyantly dressed leader who seemed to keep one foot on a wah-wah
pedal and one hand on an electric keyboard in his later years. But he
did much to popularize jazz, reversing the trend away from commercial
appeal that bebop started. And whatever the fripperies and explorations,
he retained an ability to play moving solos that endeared him to
audiences and demonstrated his affinity with tradition. He is a reminder
of the music's essential quality of boundless invention, using all
available means. Twenty-four years after Davis
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829>' death, he was the
subject of Miles Ahead, a biopic co-written and directed by Don Cheadle
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/don-cheadle-mn0001923709>, who also
portrayed him. Its soundtrack functioned as a career overview with
additional music provided by pianist Robert Glasper
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/robert-glasper-mn0000288985> and
associates. Additionally, Glasper
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/glasper-mn0000288985> enlisted many of
his collaborators to help record Everything's Beautiful
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/everythings-beautiful-mw0002928886>, a
separate release that incorporated Davis
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829>' master recordings
and outtakes into new compositions. In 2020, the trumpeter was also the
focus of director Stanley Nelson
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/stanley-nelson-mn0003911941>'s
documentary Miles Davis: Birth of the Cool
<https://www.allmusic.com/album/miles-davis-birth-of-the-cool-mw0003329953>,
which showcased music from throughout Davis
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829>' career. Also
included on the documentary's soundtrack was a newly produced track,
"Hail to the Real Chief," constructed out of previously unreleased Davis
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/davis-mn0000423829> recordings by the
trumpeter's fusion-era bandmates drummer Lenny White
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/lenny-white-mn0000246487> and drummer
(and nephew) Vince Wilburn, Jr
<https://www.allmusic.com/artist/vince-wilburn-jr-mn0001194353>.
